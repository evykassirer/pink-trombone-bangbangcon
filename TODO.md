## TODO

misc

- fix explore mode, it's off-by-1 right now
- voicebox control is sticky in explore mode
- drawPositions draws weird symbols

### IPA mappings

- functions for producing each IPA sound [0/44]
- UI click button or enter IPA symbol, get the sound

### explore stringing together mappings

- does the delay from touch to sound cause issues?
- does making all sounds happen for the same amount of time sound really weird?
  - research: which sounds do we make for longer than others
- moving between unvoiced and voiced sounds, how to time that?
  - research: when does voice turn on/off?

### research

- fricatives (app isn't very good at them)
