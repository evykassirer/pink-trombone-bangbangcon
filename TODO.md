## TODO

misc

- why do unvoiced consonants sound pretty much entirely voiced still?
- I can hear the voice start slightly before the m on mama
- the glottal on voice start (or maybe just the abruptness?) makes things like 'ha ha ha' weird
- ideally only save clicks in explore mode that are on the main section
  - voicebox control, about, etc shouldn't save
- drawPositions draws weird symbols (this might be a text editor bug!)

### IPA mappings

- IPA sounds [4/44]
- make it easier to enter ipa mappings in text field? annoying to copy paste symbols

### explore stringing together mappings

- does the delay from touch to sound cause issues?
- does making all sounds happen for the same amount of time sound really weird?
  - research: which sounds do we make for longer than others
- moving between unvoiced and voiced sounds, how to time that?
  - research: when does voice turn on/off?
  - for h it might be better if the voice transition is more gradual

### research

- fricatives (app isn't very good at them)
- the math used in the app for tongue, nose, etc (in tract-ui)
- read research papers cited in BIBLIOGRAPHY
- read notes at bottom of https://www.antimoon.com/how/pronunc-soundsipa.htm
